Embark on my first attempt at creating an intelligent bird identification system powered by TensorFlow and Python. This project leverages deep learning and computer vision to classify bird species from images, enabling accurate and efficient identification. By training a convolutional neural network (CNN) on a diverse dataset of birds, this system aims to recognize and categorize different species with precision.

With a passion for AI and wildlife, this project is a step toward bridging technology and nature. Stay tuned as I refine the model, enhance accuracy, and explore real-time classification possibilities!
